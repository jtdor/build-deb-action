# Build Debian Packages GitHub Action

This action builds Debian packages in a clean, flexible environment.

It is mainly a shell wrapper around `dpkg-buildpackage`, using a configurable
Docker image to install build dependencies in and build packages. Resulting
.deb files and other build artifacts are moved to a specified place.

In some aspects, this action is comparable to `pbuilder` and `sbuild`. It uses
Docker containers instead of chroots, though, to set up the clean, predefined
build environment.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> This action is
> [intended](https://github.com/jtdor/build-deb-action/discussions/5#discussioncomment-5512205)
> to be used with repositories that are prepared to be packaged in the standard
> Debian way. This means repositories must provide a `debian/` subdirectory
> that contains information and rules about the package(s) to be built.
>
> If you are looking for an action that packages an arbitrary repository, you
> might prefer looking for a different action on the
> [GitHub Marketplace](https://github.com/marketplace?type=actions).

## Usage
### Basic Example
```yaml
on: push

jobs:
  build-debs:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v4
      - uses: jtdor/build-deb-action@v1
        env:
          DEB_BUILD_OPTIONS: noautodbgsym
        with:
          buildpackage-opts: --build=binary --no-sign
```

### Input Parameters
All input parameters have a default value or are optional.

#### `apt-opts`
Extra options to be passed to `apt-get` when installing build dependencies and
extra packages.

Optional and empty by default.

#### `artifacts-dir`
Directory relative to the workspace where the built packages and other
artifacts will be moved to.

Defaults to `debian/artifacts` in the workspace.

#### `before-build-hook`
Shell command(s) to be executed after installing the build dependencies and right
before `dpkg-buildpackage` is executed. A single or multiple commands can be
given, same as for a
[`run` step](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/using-workflows/workflow-syntax-for-github-actions#jobsjob_idstepsrun)
in a workflow.

The hook is executed with `sh -c` as the root user *inside* the build
container. The working directory is the workspace. The package contents from
the build dependencies and [`extra-build-deps`](#extra-build-deps) are
available.

Optional and empty by default.

Example use case:
```yaml
- uses: jtdor/build-deb-action@v1
  with:
    before-build-hook: debchange --controlmaint --local="+ci${{ github.run_id }}~git$(git rev-parse --short HEAD)" "CI build"
    extra-build-deps: devscripts git
```

#### `buildpackage-opts`
Options to be passed to `dpkg-buildpackage`. See `man dpkg-buildpackage`.

Optional and empty by default.

#### `docker-image`
Name of a Debian-based Docker image to use as build container or path of a
Dockerfile in the workspace to build a temporary container from.

Defaults to `debian:stable-slim`.

#### `extra-build-deps`
Extra packages to be installed as “build dependencies”. *This should rarely be
used, build dependencies should be specified in the `debian/control` file.*

By default, these packages are installed without their recommended
dependencies. To change this, pass `--install-recommends` in
[`apt-opts`](#apt-opts).

Optional and empty by default.

#### `extra-docker-args`
Additional command-line arguments passed to `docker run` when the build
container is started. This might be needed if specific volumes or network
settings are required.

Optional and empty by default.

#### `extra-repos`
Extra APT repositories to configure as sources in the build environment.

Entries can be given in either format supported by APT: one-line style or
deb822 style, see
[`man sources.list`](https://manpages.debian.org/sources.list.5).

Optional and empty by default.

#### `extra-apt-preferences`
Extra APT preferences to configure package priorities in the build environment.

This allows you to pin packages from specific sources or set priorities to control
package selection during installation or upgrades. The preferences should be
provided in a format supported by APT, typically as entries in Package, Pin, and
Pin-Priority fields. For more details, see `man apt_preferences`.

Optional and empty by default.

#### `extra-repo-keys`
Extra keys for APT to trust in the build environment. Useful in combination
with [`extra-repos`](#extra-repos).

The parameter can be used to pass either one or multiple ASCII-armored keys, or
a newline-separated list of paths to key files in ASCII-armored or binary
format. Paths to key files must be relative to the workspace.

Optional and empty by default.

#### `host-arch`
The architecture packages are built for. If this parameter is set,
cross-building (cross-compilation) is automatically set up with `apt-get` and
`dpkg-buildpackage` as described
[in the Debian wiki](https://wiki.debian.org/CrossCompiling#Building_with_dpkg-buildpackage).

Optional and defaults to the architecture the action is run on (likely amd64).

Basic example for a cross-build:
```yaml
- uses: jtdor/build-deb-action@v1
  with:
    host-arch: i386
```

#### `setup-hook`
Shell command(s) to be executed after setting-up the build environment and
right before installing the build dependencies. A single or multiple commands
can be given, same as for a
[`run` step](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/using-workflows/workflow-syntax-for-github-actions#jobsjob_idstepsrun)
in a workflow.

The hook is executed with `sh -c` as the root user *inside* the build
container. The working directory is the workspace.

Optional and empty by default.

#### `source-dir`
Directory relative to the workspace that contains the package sources,
especially the `debian/` subdirectory.

Defaults to the workspace.

### Environment Variables
Environment variables work as you would expect. So you can use e.g. the
`DEB_BUILD_OPTIONS` variable:
```yaml
- uses: jtdor/build-deb-action@v1
  env:
    DEB_BUILD_OPTIONS: noautodbgsym
```

## Motivation
There are other GitHub actions that wrap `dpkg-buildpackage`. At the time of
writing, all of them had one or multiple limitations:
 * Hard-coding too specific options,
 * hard-coding one specific distribution as build environment,
 * installing unnecessary packages as build dependencies,
 * or expecting only exactly one .deb file.

This action’s goal is to not have any of these limitations.
